""" ï»¿Create a Python module that implements basic calculator functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Import this module into a program and perform arithmetic operations based on user input. For division operation, throw the error message if the second operand is zero.



Module Name: calculator

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the operation to be performed (+, -, *, or /).

The second and third lines of input consist of the float values which act as operands.

Output format :
The output displays the result of the operation.

When the division operation is performed, if the second operand is zero, the error message should be thrown that it cannot be divided by zero.

If the operator is not +, -, *, or /, the output displays "Invalid operation"."""




#main.py

import calculator

#Type your code here
operation = input()
n1 = float(input())
n2 = float(input())

if operation == "+":
    result = calculator.add(n1, n2)
    print(f"{n1} + {n2} = {result}")
elif operation == "-":
    result = calculator.subtract(n1, n2)
    print(f"{n1} - {n2} = {result}")
elif operation == "*":
    result = calculator.multiply(n1, n2)
    print(f"{n1} * {n2} = {result}")
elif operation == "/":
    try:
        result = calculator.divide(n1, n2)
        print(f"{n1} / {n2} = {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Error:", str(e))
else:
    print("Invalid operation")
